# where-to-fly
Wtf is an app that shows where you can fly from an airport, filterable by airline and number of connections

As of now, all of the flight, route, and airline data was pulled from a public database and lives in 3 csv files. It's also a text based website with no bells or whistles.

Goals for future versions:
1) Pull data from a live source like the ITA Matrix (Google Flights)
2) Show a map with the destinations plotted
3) Make the map interactive - allow dropdowns for filtering and zooming/panning
4) Add geolocation so the site defaults to an airport in whatever city you are currently in
